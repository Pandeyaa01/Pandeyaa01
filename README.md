- 👋 Hi, I’m Aakash Pandey. And I am a github noobie.
- 👀 I’m interested in ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.
- 🌱 I’m currently a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University. I am working on developing optimal vaccination strategies for vaccinating deer against bovine TB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything disease ecology and evolution related stuff. My specialization is in modeling, but previously, I also worked in a wet lab.
